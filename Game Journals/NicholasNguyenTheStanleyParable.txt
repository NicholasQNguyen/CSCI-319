Games are a beautiful artform because they are an inherently interactive medium. Players are allowed to make choices that impact the world
and have to live with those choices. Oftentimes, these choices are superfluous and have no effect on the overall story told. But, The 
Stanley Parable takes it in a different direction: what if every choice you made had an impact on the story?

The game is fundamentally about choice and free will. And while a book could attempt to tell a story regarding that concept, it's hard to 
be converyed unless a person themselves is making the choice and living with the consequences. The Stanley Parable makes full use of the
medium in a way that I've never seen done before to emphasize the story.

I think the most beautiful part of The Stanley Parable is the paradox the game presents. If you want Stanley to be "free," as in get out of
his job cycle, he has to follow every order given to him by the narrator. If you wish to be "free" and rebel against every order given to
you, you end up jumping off of a ledge to your death. But no matter what, the player is given the choice to follow or not. 

In some aspects, you feel like in total control of the story. I get to make my own choices narrator be damned. But eventually, you do have
to follow the narrator. In other aspects, you feel like you are totally just along for the ride. But that leads to Stanley being free. So,
it raises the question of which way can be truly considered the "free" way.

The Stanley Parable was a beautiful game that challenged my ideas of what can be done with the medium of video games from a story telling
perspective. Many games take inspiration from novels which have a linear story that has to be followed and there's nothing wrong with that.
But The Stanley Parable uses interactivity in a totally unique way to present a beautiful story.
